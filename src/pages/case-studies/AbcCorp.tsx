            <strong>Company Overview:</strong> ABC Corp is a mid-sized

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            In 2022, ABC Corp faced significant challenges in managing its
            meeting room bookings across its various offices. With a rapidly
            growing workforce, the existing manual booking system was becoming
            increasingly inefficient. Employees often faced scheduling
            conflicts, wasted time searching for available rooms, and
            frustration due to double bookings.

            Challenges
          </h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
            <li className="text-gray-600">
              Inefficient Booking Process: Employees spent an average of 15
              minutes each day trying to schedule meetings, leading to a
              collective time loss of approximately 75 hours per week.
            </li>
            <li className="text-gray-600">
              Lack of Real-Time Availability: Teams often found themselves
              unable to access updated room availability, resulting in missed
              opportunities for collaboration.
            </li>
            <li className="text-gray-600">
              Poor Resource Management: Meeting rooms were often left unused
              while other teams struggled to find space for important
              discussions.
            </li>
            <li className="text-gray-600">
              Fragmented Communication: Different departments used various tools
              for scheduling, creating confusion and miscommunication.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">Goals</h2>

            availability, improve resource utilization, and enhance
