          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            In early 2023, the firm identified a pressing need to enhance the
            client meeting experience as they expanded their clientele and
            service offerings. Previous meeting arrangements often fell short in
            professionalism and organization, affecting client perceptions and
            satisfaction. The firm sought a solution that would provide them
            with sophisticated meeting spaces that could impress clients and
            facilitate effective discussions.

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
            <li className="text-gray-600">
              Inconsistent Meeting Setup: Each meeting room had varying levels
              of equipment and setup, leading to a lack of uniformity during
              client meetings.
            </li>
            <li className="text-gray-600">
              Accessibility Issues: Employees found it difficult to reserve
              rooms that were equipped for high-stakes client meetings, leading
              to last-minute scrambles.
            </li>
            <li className="text-gray-600">
              Unprofessional Atmosphere: Meeting environments were often
              cluttered and poorly organized, affecting the overall client
              experience.
            </li>
            <li className="text-gray-600">
              Limited Feedback Mechanism: The firm lacked a streamlined process
              to gather client feedback on meeting experiences, hindering
              continuous improvement efforts.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">Goals</h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            The marketing firm aimed to enhance their client meeting experiences
            by ensuring consistency, improving accessibility to well-equipped
            meeting rooms, and fostering a professional atmosphere that would
            resonate positively with clients.
